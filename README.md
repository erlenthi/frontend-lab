# Front End Practice

This is a practice repository for front-end development. It contains multiple folders, each with HTML and CSS exercises and projects to improve front-end skills.

The contents of demos and templates are AI generated. 

# Demos 

This folder contains interactive environments for exploring behaviour of elements when attributes like padding and margins change to display for example margin collapse. 

## CSS Demos

- **display-property.html** - Demonstrates different CSS display values (block, inline, inline-block, none) and how they affect element rendering and layout behavior.

- **flexbox-grid-demo.html** - Shows the differences and use cases between CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid layouts with side-by-side examples.

- **justify-content-demo.html** - Interactive demonstration of the justify-content property in Flexbox, showing all alignment options (flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly).

- **margin-demo.html** - Explores CSS margin behavior including margin collapse, negative margins, and how margins affect spacing between elements.

- **padding-fixed-demo.html** - Demonstrates padding properties and their effects on element sizing, including how padding interacts with width and the box-sizing property.

Templates included are 

- **flexbox** - Flexbox layout templates with comments for alternative configurations
- **grid** - CSS Grid layout templates with comments for complex grid patterns
